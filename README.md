# Movie Ratings
## Overview
This project was created to attempt to better understand what qualities go into a movie being highly rated. The ratings in this dataset were by IMDb, a popular website that contains information about movies and TV shows. 

## Dataset
**Link:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/movie-gross-and-ratings-from-1989-to-2014
- This dataset contains the top 20 movies each year from 1989-2014, for a total of 510 observations
- The factors I used movie genre, age certification (i.e. PG, PG-13, R), budget, and run-time to test their effects on movie rating

# I have included a pdf report that sums up the business problem, the data, my findings, and the conclusion.

## Use Cases
**Film Producers:** Offers real data on which categories typically produce high rated movies
**Avid Movie Watchers:** Allows them to pick and choose movies based on this criteria for their viewing pleasure
